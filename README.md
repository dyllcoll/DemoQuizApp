# Setup Instructions

# How to clone this repository to your local machine.

# git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app.git

# Open index.html in your browser to start the quiz.

# Optionally, open the project in a text editor to modify the quiz questions or styling.

# How It Works

# When the user clicks "Start Quiz", the quiz begins with a timer for each question.

# The user selects an answer from the provided options. Once a selection is made, it cannot be undone.

# The timer counts down from 15 seconds, and once time runs out, the user cannot select an answer.

# At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, and they have the option to replay the quiz or quit.
